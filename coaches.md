If you'd like to coach a team, please take the following steps:

1. **Register** as a coach at [GotSport](https://system.gotsport.com/programs/4K7316426?reg_role=coach
)

2. Complete **coaching classes**. All coaches must complete these classes every year.
   Please find them at the end of the [CalNorth Coaching Education](
   https://www.calnorth.org/coachingeducation) page, under "Additional Coaching Education".
   You'll need to complete and submit each of the required lessons listed there,
   "Introduction to Safe and Healthy Playing Environments" and
   "Safe Sport Training".

3. Register a **Live Scan**. This only needs to be done once by each league coach --
   you don't need to do it annually -- but a Live Scan for another sport or league
   cannot be used by MAYSL.
   1. Fill out the [MAYSL Live Scan form](/files/maysl-livescan-2022.pdf).
   2. Make an appointment with the Oakhurst Sherrif's office to submit your form
   3. Bring your form and [a current, valid photo ID](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)
      to your appointment. You will be fingerprinted and your identity will be verified when
      they complete your form and submit it.
   4. Note that the submission is free for MAYSL coaches.
