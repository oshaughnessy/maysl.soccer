MAYSL is looking for home game referees! We're hosting a 5-hour course to
learn to be a ref. All interested youth or adults are welcome.

Text or call Kay Emmert at [559-301-2528](tel:559-301-2528) to sign up.

**Who?** Anyone 13 or older

**Where?** Rivergold Elementary School

**When?** August 28, 11:30-4:30


**What should you bring?**

Definitely bring:
* a notebook and something to write with
* drinks and snacks

It would be good to have:
* a whistle
* a coin
* a clock and a stopwatch
* flags

Uniform will be a gray t-shirt, black shorts with no white, black socks,
and mostly black shoes. _You will get a badge to iron on your shirt after
completing the course._

If you are 18 or older, you must complete a background check.

New coaches, this is a great way to learn the rules, especially since
under-8 teams reffed their own games last year.
