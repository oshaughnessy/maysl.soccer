Picture day for the fall 2022 season will be on Saturday, October 29.

Team photos will be taken in the lot by the wooden bridge closest to
campus, next to the parking lot. Most teams should show up an hour
before their game time.

For teams with 8am games, plan on getting photos after the games.
U5 teams, please arrive for photos at 8am.

If any team needs another time, please reach out to
[Kay](mailto:kayemmert@yahoo.com).

and bring it with you on picture day. Team photos and a few individuals
are included as part of the season's registration fees; any additional
