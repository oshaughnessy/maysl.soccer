title: Birth Verification Required
tag: 2022-season registration
---

Birth verification for some players is required before they can continue play.
During initial registration for the 2022 fall season, our system's birth verification
feature didn't work. Fortunately, it was repaired midway through the registration
period, but many of our players are still missing this information, and it's
required before those players are covered by the league's insurance.

If you received a notice from GotSport or a league representative that your player's
birth verification is missing, please provide it right away. You may use a birth
certificate, passport, or immunization record.

Thank you! We don't want to suspend play for anyone.
