have not in the past) and a picture of your child.  It must be
like a school picture without anyone else in the picture and no
hats or animals. Think school picture!!!! Make sure the picture
is up to date. We have some very young pictures that need to be
removed and replaced.

If you are on a travel team you must have the permission of the
coach or myself before your registration can be accepted.

Registrations must be paid in full before you will
be allowed to play on a team.

If you want a new jersey please order one with registration unless
you are a member of the travel team.

You must be registered by July 20th to be placed on the team you
played with last year.
