Matches are held at 2 locations:
- YHS: [the lower fields behind Yosemite High School](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=15DpY24JXKTKon10Baj6W7fcm1qhHobo&usp=sharing).
  Drive into the main entrance of the campus off High School Rd. Follow it
  past the parking lot on the left and the swimming pool complex on the right,
  all the way to the dirt lot at the end. Matches are held in the 1st field to
  the right of that parking area.
- MCHS: [Grizzly Field at Mariposa County High School](https://goo.gl/maps/k4L7ExrhjSRKLZcf6).
  Drive into the main entrance of the campus off Old Highway N. Park near the new building and
  look for the field with the big lights above it. Walk up the path in between the buildings
  to get to the field.

Games are played in 30-minute halves, played weekly on Saturday or Sunday.

Matches will be added to the schedule throughout the season, as more
information becomes available.
