This page highlights the rules we apply at each age division and when we either
introduce them as teaching steps or really begin to enforce them.
For more details, please see [Rules]({% link _pages/rules.md %}#growing-with-the-game).

To summarize the progression of teaching and enforcing rules:
* **U10:** introduce offside, substitutions, and throw-ins
* **U12:** allow drop-kicks
* **U15:** allow heading


## U6

There are no real soccer rules in this division. The whole experience is
about introducing the basic game and letting our youngest players have fun.

Specific behaviors:
* no heading
* no throw-ins -- coaches should throw in from out of bounds


## U8

Kids are still learning to have fun with the game, and they're just
beginning to learn the rules. Be gentle with rules; teaching is
needed much more than enforcement. Many coaches will be new here
along with their kids, so you may be teaching coaches and parents
as much as players.

Do not fully enforce offenses early in the season. Teach the players
what they did wrong so that they can learn from it. On repeated
offenses by a given player, begin to enforce a rule. Ensure that
coaches understand what's being enforced as well.

### Goalkeepers

No goals may be scored on direct kick from a goalkeeper.

No drop-kicks are allowed by the goalkeeper.

### Heading

Heading is never allowed in this division.

A heading offense results in an _indirect free kick_ to the opposing
team at the place of the header. If it happens inside the penalty
area, move the ball outside the penalty box first.

### Offside

Offside offenses are not enforced.

### Substitutions

If a team is large enough, sub entire groups of players at once.

Otherwise, follow normal rules and allow substitutions whenever the
ball has gone out of play.

### Throw-ins

Throw-ins are not done in U8 at MAYSL. 

Players should kick in from the point where the ball went outside
the field of play.

_Why?_ See [Throw-Ins in U10]({% link _pages/rules.md %}#throw-ins-in-u10) for more info.


## U10

### Build-Out Line and Offside

The red-colored build-out line is only used in U10, and is placed
between the midfield line and each penalty box line.

Use the build-out line to keep space between a goalkeeper and the
opposing players.  Opposing players must be behind the build-out
line whenever the goalkeeper has the ball in hand or is taking a
goal kick. Goalkeepers are allowed to wait until all opposing players
are behind the line.

Teach offsides only when an offside offense is behind the build-out
line, but enforce it at your discretion, after players have had
part of the season to learn it.  Advise the coaches if you're going
to enforce it during a game.  Note that it is not an offside offense
to receive the ball from a corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in. See
our [Rules section on offside in 10+]({% link _pages/rules.md
%}#offside-in-u10) for more info.

### Goalkeepers

Goals _may be_ scored on direct kick from a goalkeeper.

No drop-kicks are allowed by the goalkeeper.

### Handball

Handball offenses should be enforced with discretion. Players are still learning to
suppress the instinct to bring hands up to protect themselves. For details, see
["Handling the ball" in section 1 of Law 12](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#direct-free-kick).

### Heading

Heading is never allowed in this division.

A heading offense results in an _indirect free kick_ to the opposing
team at the place of the header. If it happens inside the penalty
area, move the ball outside the penalty box first.

### Substitutions

Allow subs only when the ball is out of play.

### Throw-ins

Enforce proper throw-in technique.


## U12

### Goalkeepers

Goals _may be scored_ on direct kick from a goalkeeper.
Players are not offside if they interact with a ball kicked directly
from the goalkeeper.

Drop-kicks are allowed by the goalkeeper beginning in U12.

Teach that goalies cannot use hands when passed the ball from their own players,
but limit enforcement to avoid creating severe advantages to the opposing team
near their target goal.

### Heading

No heading of the ball is allowed. According to CYSA District 7 rules, heading is
only allowed beginning in U15.

An offense results in an _indirect free kick_ to the opposing
team at the place of the header. If it happens inside the penalty
area, move the ball outside the penalty box first.

### Offside

Offside can be enforced in full beginning with U12.

Players are not offside if they interact with a ball received directly
from a corner kick, a goal kick, or a throw-in.

Offsides lead to an _indirect free kick_ where the offense occurred.


## U15+

1. **Heading is allowed.**
2. Strictly enforce all rules, including:
  1. offside
  2. use of hands & arms causes a penalty kick
  3. use of hands by goalkeepers on a touch from their own teammates causes a penalty kick
