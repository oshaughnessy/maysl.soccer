## Registration

If you'd like to coach a team, please take the following steps:

1. **Register** as a coach at [GotSport](https://system.gotsport.com/programs/4K7316426?reg_role=coach
)

2. Complete **coaching classes**. All coaches must complete these classes every year.
   Please find them at the end of the [CalNorth Coaching Education](
   https://www.calnorth.org/coachingeducation) page, under "Additional Coaching Education".
   You'll need to complete and submit each of the required lessons listed there,
   "Introduction to Safe and Healthy Playing Environments" and "Safe Sport Training".
   Be sure to use your full legal name when you register for the courses.

3. Register a **Live Scan**. This only needs to be done once by each league coach --
   you don't need to do it annually -- but a Live Scan for another sport or league
   cannot be used by MAYSL.
   1. Fill out the [MAYSL Live Scan form](/files/calnorth-livescan-2022.pdf).
      Use your full legal name, as found on your driver's license or California ID.
   2. Make an appointment with the Oakhurst Sheriff's office to submit your form.
   3. Bring your form and [a current, valid photo ID](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)
      to your appointment. You will be fingerprinted and your identity will be verified when
      they complete your form and submit it.
   4. Note that the submission is free for MAYSL coaches.

**Please Note**:
For all registrations and courses, it is essential that you use your full legal name.
The systems that match your course completions and Live Scan application will only be able
to connect your information to our soccer registration system if they all have the same name,
and the Live Scan application runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will
need to match your registered legal name.


## Coaching

### Player Age

[According to the CYSA](https://cysadistrict7.org/forms-policies/birth-year-and-season-matrix/),
the "U" in each division (_U5_, _U10_, etc) means "that age and under": _U13_
includes 13-year-olds, _U10_ includes 10-year-olds, etc. But that applies to
their age at the end of _the year the league's season ends_.

In the mountain area, MAYSL just plays soccer in the fall, but the CalNorth
league's season starts then and ends the next spring. So a season that starts
in August 2022 is technically the 2022-2023 season. When their site says _UX_
means "age _X_ and under", they're talking about the end-of-season year,
and each player's age by the end of that year is their league age.

For MAYSL, it's easier to think of _U10_ as "under 10", and the player's age at
the start of the season tells you what division they're in. _U10_ is for kids
under 10, etc.

See [Five Things to Know About Birth Year Registration](
https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2017/08/five-things-to-know-about-birth-year-registration)
at ussoccer.com for an explanation of the change when it was rolled out in 2017.


### Player Safety

Print out a copy of the [Concussion Recognition Tool](/files/concussion-field-guide.pdf)
that was provided as part of the US Soccer safety coarse. Familiarize yourself with it
and keep it with your field bag or clipboard. You'll have it available if one of your
players has any sign of a head injury.

### Rule Highlights

[Within US Youth Soccer](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/referees/rules-of-the-game/),
the [FIFA Laws of the Game](https://www.ussoccer.com/referee-program/laws-of-the-game)
are used.
Section _4:04_ of the [MAYSL Constitution](/files/maysl-by-laws.pdf) talks about
**Player Development**:

_4:04:01_ Each player must participate a minimum of 50% of every game. Applies to all
age groups and teams.

_4:04:02_ For U8 and U10 teams, each player must play each field position
at least once during the season.
