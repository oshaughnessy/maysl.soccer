## Registration

If you'd like to coach a team, please take the following steps:

1. **Register** as a coach at [GotSport](https://system.gotsport.com/programs/4K7316426?reg_role=coach
)

2. Complete **coaching classes**. All coaches must complete these classes every year.
   Please find them at the end of the [CalNorth Coaching Education](
   https://www.calnorth.org/coachingeducation) page, under "Additional Coaching Education".
   You'll need to complete and submit each of the required lessons listed there,
   "Introduction to Safe and Healthy Playing Environments" and "Safe Sport Training".
   Be sure to use your full legal name when you register for the courses.

3. Register a **Live Scan**. This only needs to be done once by each league coach --
   you don't need to do it annually -- but a Live Scan for another sport or league
   cannot be used by MAYSL.
   1. Fill out the [MAYSL Live Scan form](/files/maysl-livescan-2022.pdf).
      Use your full legal name, as found on your driver's license or California ID.
   2. Make an appointment with the Oakhurst Sheriff's office to submit your form.
   3. Bring your form and [a current, valid photo ID](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)
      to your appointment. You will be fingerprinted and your identity will be verified when
      they complete your form and submit it.
   4. Note that the submission is free for MAYSL coaches.

**Please Note**:
For all registrations and courses, it is essential that you use your full legal name.
The systems that match your course completions and Live Scan application will only be able
to connect your information to our soccer registration system if they all have the same name,
and the Live Scan application runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will
need to match your registered legal name.
