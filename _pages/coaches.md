All of our coaches are volunteers. We have many that come back year
after year to lead our kids, but we will always welcome new coaches
as well. First-time parent volunters and leaders with experience at
other organizations will all have something valuable to contribute.

If you're interested, please reach out to the [area rep](/contact/)
for your school, then see the [Registration](#registration) section
below.


## Coaching

### Player Age

You may get questions from parents when they're signing up their kids, wanting to know
which team they'll be on.

For MAYSL, it's most natural to think of _U-something_ as "under that age"
and the player's age at the end of fall tells you what division they're in.
This way, _U10_ is actually for kids under 10 that year.

This isn't _technically_ correct, though. Read on for a more accurate
breakdown.

[According to the CYSA](
https://cysadistrict7.org/forms-policies/birth-year-and-season-matrix/),
the "U" in each division (_U5_, _U10_, etc) means "that age and under": _U13_
*includes* 13-year-olds, _U10_ *includes* 10-year-olds, etc. But that applies to
their age at the end of _the year the league's season ends_.

In the mountain area, MAYSL just plays soccer in the fall, but the CalNorth
league's season starts then and ends the next spring. So a season that starts
in August 2022 is technically the 2022-2023 season. When their site says _UX_
means "age _X_ and under", they're talking about the end-of-season year,
and each player's age by the end of that 2nd calendar year is their league age.

See [Five Things to Know About Birth Year Registration](
https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2017/08/five-things-to-know-about-birth-year-registration)
at ussoccer.com for an explanation of the move to birth year divisions
when it was rolled out in 2017.


### Player Safety

Learn about **concussion** symptoms and how to deal with potential head injuries.
Print out a copy of the [Concussion Recognition Tool](/files/concussion-field-guide.pdf)
that was provided as part of the US Soccer safety course. Familiarize yourself with it
and keep it with your field bag or clipboard. You'll have it available if one of your
players has any sign of a head injury.

Heat-related ilness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
[Recognize to Recover Heat Guidelines](/files/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf).


### Rule Highlights

[Within US Youth Soccer](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/referees/rules-of-the-game/),
the [FIFA Laws of the Game](https://www.ussoccer.com/referee-program/laws-of-the-game)
are used.

Section _4:04_ of the [MAYSL Constitution](/files/maysl-by-laws.pdf) talks about
**Player Development**:

_4:04:01_ Each player must participate a minimum of 50% of every game. Applies to all
age groups and teams.

_4:04:02_ For U8 and U10 teams, each player must play each field position
at least once during the season.

See [rules](/rules/) for more.


#### Offside and the Build-Out Line

We enforce offside rules at U10 and above. Build-out lines are used only
on U10 fields to introduce the concept gracefully.

This page at US Soccer,
[Five Things to Know: How Small-Sided Standards Will Change Youth Soccer](
https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2017/08/five-things-to-know-how-smallsided-standards-will-change-youth-soccer),
talks about using build-out lines to introduce the concept at the U9 level
(but we don't do U9 here, so we start with U10). That new off-color line
halfway between the center and penalty lines marks the offside line
for younger players. This gets them thinking about their field position
in a way that creates fairer team play for both the offense and defense.

> Starting at the U-9 level, games will use build-out lines. A horizontal
> line drawn from sideline to sideline 14-yards in front of each goal,
> build-out lines will encourage possession and playing the ball out of the
> back. When a goalkeeper has the ball in hand or takes a goal kick, the
> opposing team remains behind the build-out line until the ball is put into
> play. This line also indicates where offside can be called, as teams cannot
> be called for offside between the midfield and build-out line. As part of
> small-sided standards, there will be no offside infraction before the U-9
> age group. New rules also ban headers as well as punts and drop kicks from
> the goalkeeper.

See our [Growing with the Game](/rules/#growing-with-the-game) section for more
on age group differences.

#### Lead Limits

The league expects its coaches to teach proper sportsmanship to players.
When a team is leading by a margin of 3 goals, the coach should incorporate
changes into the game to actively level the playing field. All efforts must
be made to keep a margin of victory to never more than 5 goals.

Examples of actions that could be taken include:

* Switching players' positions around to enable those who haven't
  scored goals the opportunity to do so.
* Imposing restrictions on players, such as:
    * shooting with "weaker" foot only
    * requiring 5 (or more?) consecutive passes (without an opponent
      touching the ball) before a shot can be taken
    * requiring that those passes are completed in the team's own
      defensive half
    * other combinations that keep your own players' challenge level up
      in a way that doesn't obviously play down to the opposing team

Examples of actions that are *not* acceptable include:

* removing players to play down against a team;
* removing a goalkeeper or changing the role of the goalkeeper.

Coaches should make every effort to prepare their players for this
type of a situation _before_ it happens. This will allow a team to
practice fair play without broadcasting it on the field. A coach
can choose a secret word so that players are prepared for the
situation or sub in a player who can pass on the instructions
to teammates.

**We are a recreational league and our priorities are fun,
skill development, and encouragement for ALL players.**

## FAQ

### _What if I can't make all the games?_

An assistant coach or a team parent can cover practices and games
if the head coach can't make it. Don't let that hold you back from
signing up as a coach!

### _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken in the 2nd half of the season, after the
October break, and it always happens on a game day at the YHS
game field. Keep an eye on the [News](/news/) page for an
announcement each season.

### _When and where can I practice?_

At the start of each season, your [area rep](/contact/) will coordinate
fields and times with all of their coaches.

### _Can I borrow players for a game?_

Yes, guest players can be pulled in for both recreational and competitive/travel
games. CYSA District 7 outlines the essentials in their [Playing Program Handbook](
https://cysadistrict7.org/for-coaches/playing-program-handbook/). See our
[rules on guest players](/rules/#guest-players--team-size) on the Rules page for details.

### What should I keep in my coach bag?

Handy items:
* 2 extra water bottles: 1 to refill player bottles and another for yourself
* 2 colors of pinnies -- very useful for dividing your team during practice
  (the ref station will always have some available if needed during a game)
* brightly colored cones to create exercise areas or courses during practice
* goalie gloves
* a ball pump and spare air needles
* a ballpoint pen to fill out game cards
* a first aid kit

For the first aid kit, US Youth Soccer has a [suggested list of first aid items
here](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/news/the_spectators_first_aid_kit/).
Consider printing out their [ice or heat?](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/news/ice_or_heat/)
page to keep in the bag as well.
