## Eligibility

Kids ages 3-18 can play soccer with the Mountain Area Youth Soccer League.
You can find out your player's age for league placement at the
[CYSA Division 7 League Age Chart](https://cysadistrict7.org/forms-policies/birth-year-and-season-matrix/)
or the 
[CalNorth Age Calculator](https://www.calnorth.org/soccer-age).
([See below for more details](#how-do-i-know-my-kids-league-age).)


## Register

If you'd like to sign up your kids:

1. **Register** players at [GotSport](https://system.gotsport.com/programs/88407263X?reg_role=player)
    * Registration for travel teams ends in mid-July.
    * Registration for local teams ends in mid-August.

2. Your players will be **assigned to teams** starting the week after school starts.
   Coaches will reach out that week or next to discuss practices.

3. The **first games** for local (non-travel) teams is generally the 1st or 2nd week
   of September.

4. The **last games** of the season will be on the weekend before Thanksgiving.

**See the [News](/updates/) section for specific dates.**

### How do I know my kids' league age?

At MAYSL, teams usually separate into divisions for U4, U5, U6, U8, U10, U12 or U13,
U14 or U15, and U18.

[ussoccer.com says](
https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2017/08/us-soccer-player-development-initiatives-officially-roll-out
),
"an age group can be determined by subtracting the birth year from the year the season ends."

1. Our current season ends in 2023
2. Subtract your child's birth year
3. The result is their league age
4. The division they're in must be at or below their league age

For example, U13 is for kids 13 and under. If your child was born in 2010,
they'd be in U13 because 2023-2010 is 13.


## Player Safety

US Soccer places a lot of value on player safety. If your child has any special
health conditions, like the need for an EpiPen or an inhaler, please talk to your
coaches about it. Make sure they know how to recognize signs of problems and how
to deal with them. They'll want to be prepared in case there's an emergency,
and they should be able to recognize changes in your childrens' normal behavior.


## Equipment

What do your kids need to play soccer with MAYSL?

* shoes or cleats
* shin guards
* socks
* shorts

The league will provide jerseys and soccer balls for the team.

What can't your kids wear?

* jewelry (any kind)
* watches
* hard medical devices (e.g. casts, plastic knee braces)
* hats (goalkeepers may wear baseball-style caps, though)

See [Law 4, The Players' Equipment](
https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-players-equipment/),
for the exact rules.

More guidance for how we approach equiment at MAYSL is given below.

Your Soccer Home has a great page on [What You Can (and Can't) Wear for Soccer](
https://yoursoccerhome.com/what-you-can-and-cant-wear-for-soccer/), too.

### Soccer shoes

_Can you use cleats from another sport?_ You sure can, as long as they're just
plastic knobs and they don't have a front stud like baseball and football
cleats often do.

_Can you use shoes that aren't cleats?_ Yes, but they should be appropriate
for sports -- think "outdoor athletic shoes" -- with enough traction
to keep your kids from slipping on the grass, and laces in good enough shape
that they stay firmly on your kids' feet. Nobody wants to see your kid fall
and get hurt or lose their shoe during a kick.

Many soccer players will want soccer cleats because they're designed for
good ball control: they fit the shape of your foot, they keep you nimble for
quick turns and sprints, they allow for feel in the toe while still allowing
you to make a solid kick, and they give firm traction in a variety of
field conditions.

### Socks

Uniform socks should rise to just below the player's knee. They must
fully cover the player's shin guards.

Sock colors are up to each team's coaches. For travel teams, all players'
socks must match.

### Shin guards

Shin guards are required. They must be in good condition with adequate
coverage of the player's lower leg. What does that mean? All modern
shin guards will have their intended height range etched into the plastic.
Your player can wear them if they fit within that range.

Shin guards do not need to have straps or stirrups, but they must be
fully covered under the player's socks.

### Shorts

Most teams at MAYSL wear black (or _mostly_ black) shorts. They should be a
loose-fitting sports style (not cargo shorts, denim, or form-fitting exercise
shorts, for example). Tights or bicycle-style shorts can be worn _underneath_,
but they should also be black.

Goalkeepers may wear tracksuit bottoms instead of shorts.

### Other clothing

A long-sleeve shirt or a sweatshirt without a hood may be worn under the
game jersey.

Goalkeepers are allowed to wear a baseball-style cap as long as the brim
is facing the front.

Sports-oriented sunglasses are allowed, but they should be made to withstand
the rigors of the game. It's up to the referee at any given game to exercise
their judgement, but as a general guideline, they should have strong plastic
lenses (no glass) and durable plastic frames.

### Jewelry

Law 4 is very clear:

> All items of jewellery (necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, leather bands,
> rubber bands, etc.) are forbidden and must be removed. Using tape to cover
> jewellery is not permitted.

(Americans, that's "jewelry" to us. :-)

This is an important one to keep in mind well before the season starts. There
are no exceptions for fresh piercings where the studs or earrings shouldn't
be removed within the first weeks. If a player won't remove them, they can't play.
