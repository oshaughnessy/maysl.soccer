## Eligibility

Kids ages 3-18 can play soccer with the Mountain Area Youth Soccer League.
You can find out your players' age for league placement at the
[CYSA Division 7 League Age Chart](https://cysadistrict7.org/forms-policies/birth-year-and-season-matrix/)
or the 
[CalNorth Age Calculator](https://www.calnorth.org/soccer-age).
([See below for more details](#how-do-i-know-my-kids-league-age).)


## Register

If you'd like to sign up your kids:

1. **Register** players at [GotSport](https://system.gotsport.com/programs/88407263X?reg_role=player)
    * Registration for travel teams ends on July 10, 2022.
    * Registration for local teams ends on Aug 15, 2022.

2. Your players will be **assigned to teams** starting the week of August 14.
   Coaches will reach out that week or next to discuss practices.

3. The **first games** for local (non-travel) teams will be on Saturday, Sept 10.

4. The **last games** of the season will be on the weekend before Thanksgiving.


## How do I know my kids' league age?

At MAYSL, teams usually separate into divisions for U4, U5, U6, U8, U10, U12 or U13,
U14 or U15, and U18.

Here's the easiest way to think about it:

1. Take the fall season's start year
2. Subtract your child's birth year (exact birthday doesn't matter)
3. Now you have their league age.
3. They'll be in the "under" division for the next age up.

For example, if our season starts in 2022 and your child was born in 2010,
she'll be 12 sometime in 2022 and be on the U13 girls' team.

(Technically, U13 is for [kids 13 and under](
https://cysadistrict7.org/forms-policies/birth-year-and-season-matrix/):
the math uses the end-of-season year and seasons end in the spring.
