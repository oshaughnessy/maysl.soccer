## How do I know my kids' league age?

At MAYSL, teams usually separate into divisions for U4, U5, U6, U8, U10, U12 or U13,
U14 or U15, and U18.

[ussoccer.com says](
https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2017/08/us-soccer-player-development-initiatives-officially-roll-out
),
"an age group can be determined by subtracting the birth year from the year the season ends."

1. Our current season ends in 2023
2. Subtract your child's birth year
3. The result is their league age
4. The division they're in must be at or below their league age

For example, U13 is for kids 13 and under. If your child was born in 2010,
they'd be in U13 because 2023-2010 is 13.
