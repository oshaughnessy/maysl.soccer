2. Your players will be **assigned to teams** starting the week of August 14.

## How do I know my kids' league age?

The US Youth Soccer age formula goes like this:

1. Our current season ends in 2023
2. Subtract your child's birth year
3. The result is their league age
4. The division they're in must be at or below their league age

For example, U13 is for kids 13 and under. If your child was born in 2010,
they'd be in U13 because 2023-2010 is 13.
