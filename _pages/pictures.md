Team and player pictures are taken every year, near the end of
the season. The league registration fee includes a team photo
and a few individual player pictures, and custom packages are
usually available for purchase as well.

For detailed information on the current season's Picture Day,
please check the [News](/news/) section mid-season for
[posts on pictures](/tags/#pictures).

Photos are taken in the lot by the wooden bridge closest to the
YHS campus, next to the parking lot.
