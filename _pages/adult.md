The winter adult league is designed to be a casual, recreational soccer experience for the 
greater Oakhurst community of soccer-loving friends.  _It is not offered by MAYSL, but is created
by some of the same people_. 2026 will be its first season.

We will run the season for 8 weeks, from Jan 10 to March 1, with games on Saturdays and Sundays.

Recommended team sizes are 12-20+ players. Teams are coed, 18 and over. During games, teams
should always keep 2 or more women on the field. Make your teams big enough that players can
miss a game or two -- this is supposed to be fun and low-commitment.

Games will be hosted at the YHS field where MAYSL hosts U12 games, and games will be played
7v7, 8v8, or 9v9, depending on availability at game time.

If you live closer to Mariposa, check out [Mariposa Soccer's Adult League](https://www.mariposasoccer.com/adult).
It's a wonderful program and inspired us to start playing in Oakhurst.
