The winter adult league is a fundraiser for MAYSL's youth programs, and it's designed to be a casual,
recreational soccer experience for the greater Oakhurst community of soccer-loving friends.
2026 is its first season.

The season runs for 8 weeks, from Jan 10 to March 1, with games on Saturdays.

Teams are 12-20+ players, coed, 18 and over. Sign up with friends, make your own team,
or we'll be happy to place you on one. Teams should be big enough that players can miss 
some games -- this is supposed to be fun and low-commitment -- and should have enough women
that they can keep 2 or more women on the field during games.

Games will be hosted at the YHS field where MAYSL hosts U12 games, and games will be played
7v7, 8v8, or 9v9, depending on availability at game time.

It's a wonderful program and inspired us to start playing in Oakhurst.

## Season Guide

This is a **casual co-ed league**. We accept all ages, 18-and-over, so please be mindful that
we will have a wide spectrum of physical abilities and soccer skills on the field.

**Referees** will oversee games whenever possible. If no regular ref is available,
we'll look for experienced players from the league. This league should be a safe place
for aspiring referees to gain experience in a low-stakes environment.

**Practices** are optional. Some teams will do it, some won't -- it's up to each team.

**Participation is _at your own risk_.** All players are required to sign a liability waiver.

### Pre-Season

* All players must be registered with the league and sign a liability waiver.
* Players are encouraged to purchase soccer cleats and shin guards, but neither is required.
* Team jerseys will be provided by the league.

### Pre-Game

* Home team should provide 2 game balls.
* Captains should verify they have enough women to keep 2 on the field.
  If it will be a challenge, look for subs from other teams.
* Captains should discuss mercy rules.
* Adjust competition size as appropriate for player availability, skill, and fitness:
  play 7v7, 8v8, or 9v9.

### Rules

* _Substitutions are hockey style:_ exit the game and return as needed,
  don't wait for the ball to be out of play or the ref to acknowledge.
* _Coed:_ at least 2 women on the game field at all times.
* _Slide tackling_ is absolutely forbidden.
* _Cleats and shin guards_ are not required, but are recommended. Shoes with a toe cleat
  are strongly discouraged. Metal cleats are not permitted.
* _Score will be kept_ by the referees and reported to the league admins.
  This is all for fun, but so are league standings!
