2 adult soccer leagues are offered in our mountain communities,
one hosted at [Yosemite High School in Oakhurst](http://masl.soccer/),
and one hosted by [Mariposa Soccer](https://www.mariposasoccer.com/adult) at Woodland Park.

--

The Oakhurst-area league is _not hosted_ by MAYSL, but is run by some of the same _people_.

This is their first year. It is designed to be a casual, recreational off-season league for
the parents of MAYSL players and their community of soccer-loving friends and fellow athletes.

Games will be hosted at the YHS field where MAYSL hosts U12 games, and games will be played
7v7, 8v8, or 9v9, depending on availability at game time.

Recommended team sizes are 12-20+ players.

Please note again: the adult league is not created by MAYSL and is not affiliated with
US Youth Soccer or the California Youth Soccer Association.
