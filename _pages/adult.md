The winter adult league is a fundraiser for MAYSL's youth programs, and it's designed to be a
casual, recreational soccer experience for the greater Oakhurst community of soccer-loving
friends.  2026 is its first season.

The season runs for 8 weeks, from Jan 10 to March 1, with games on Saturdays.

Teams are 12-20+ players, coed, 18 and over. Sign up with friends, make your own team,
or we'll be happy to place you on one. Teams should be big enough that players can miss 
some games -- this is supposed to be fun and low-commitment -- and should have enough
women that they can keep 2 or more on the field during games.

Games will be hosted at [the YHS field where MAYSL hosts U12 games]({% link _pages/schedules.md %}/#game-fields),
and games will be played 7v7, 8v8, or 9v9, depending on availability at game time.

It's a wonderful program and inspired us to start playing in Oakhurst.

## Season Guide

This is a **casual co-ed league**. We accept all ages, 18-and-over, so please be mindful
that we will have a wide spectrum of physical abilities and soccer skills on the field.

**Referees** will oversee games whenever possible. If no regular ref is available,
we'll look for experienced players from the league. This should be a safe place
for aspiring referees to gain experience in a low-stakes environment.

**Practices** are optional. Some teams will do it, some won't -- it's up to each team.

**Participation is _at your own risk_.** All players are required to sign a liability waiver.

### Pre-Season

* Soccer cleats and shin guards are required.
* Team jerseys will be provided by the league.
* All players must be registered with the league and sign a liability waiver.

### Pre-Game

* The league will provide game balls.
* Captains should verify they have enough women to keep 2 on the field.
  If it will be a challenge, look for subs from other teams.
* Captains should discuss mercy rules.
* Adjust competition size as appropriate for player availability, skill, and fitness:
  play 7v7, 8v8, or 9v9.
* Practices are not league events -- practice as you like, or don't. Up to you where, when, and if.

### Rules

* _Substitutions are hockey style:_ exit the game and return as needed,
  don't wait for the ball to be out of play or the ref to acknowledge.
* _Coed:_ at least 2 women on the game field at all times (not including goalkeepers).
* _Slide tackling_ is absolutely forbidden.
* _Cleats and shin guards_ are required. Shoes with a toe cleat are strongly discouraged.
  Metal cleats are not permitted.
* _Score will be kept_ by the referees and reported to the league admins.
  This is all for fun, but so are league standings!


## Schedule

Games are 60 minutes, with two 25m halves and a 10m halftime.

Please help games start on time so that delays don't pile up
and force late starts for subsequent games.

The 1:15pm slot each week is marked _OPEN_.
