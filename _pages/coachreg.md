Anyone who spends significant time with our players must register.
This includes coaches, of course, but team helpers and parents, too.
If you're interested, please reach out to the [area rep](/contact/)
for your school and follow the registration process below.


## Overview

If you'd like to help out with a team in any significant way, please take the
following steps. If you have more questions, details can be found further down.

1. **Register** as a coach at GotSport (see the signup links at the top of this
   page on mobile or upper left on a computer).

    Once you've registered at GotSport, you should see a list of
    things to do in your account dashboard. Links for each class
    or form are right there in the list, under the _Details_ column.
    Please be sure to use your full legal name for all of the forms.

2. [Complete **coaching courses**](#coaching-requirements). You'll need to complete and
   submit each of the lessons listed there, "Introduction to Safe and Healthy Playing
   Environments" and "Safe Sport Training". It all takes a few hours the first time
   you do it, but when you come back next year `:-)`, each one only takes about 30 minutes.

3. Submit the form for a [**background check**](#background-checks).

4. [Get fingerprinted through a **Live Scan**](#live-scan). This only needs to be done once by each league
   coach -- you don't need to do it annually -- but a Live Scan for another sport or league
   cannot be used by MAYSL.

**Please Note**:
For all registrations and courses, it is essential that you use your full legal name.
The systems that match your course completions and Live Scan application will only be able
to connect your information to our soccer registration system if they all have the same name,
and the Live Scan application runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will
need to match your registered legal name.

## Coaching Requirements

Once you've registered as a coach, you should see a table called "Requirements"
in your GotSport account dashboard. If you don't see that section, click on
the big box that says "Mountain Area Youth Soccer League". It will open up and
you should see the table.

The league needs to see proof that you've finished your coaching
classes, and this is where you can record all of that.  The way to
provide proof varies by course.

**If you have trouble with GotSport registration, you can still start on your courses.**

The coaching course requirements are listed at the bottom of the [CalNorth Coaching Education
page](https://www.calnorth.org/coachingeducation):
   
   * [Introduction to Safe and Healthy Playing Environments](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/32/details/6165)
   * [Safe Sport Training](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606)

### Intro to Health and Safety

You can upload a screenshot from your [US Soccer account profile](
https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach) and upload it to your
[Got Sport profile](https://system.gotsport.com/), where our admins will be able to see it.

After you complete the class, go to your US Soccer profile page. You can find a link to
it after clicking on your name in the upper right corner of the site. Somewhere near the
bottom of your profile, on the right side, you'll see a box called "Safety Certifications"
showing the dates that you completed them. Please take a screenshot of that and upload it
into your Got Sport profile.

### SafeSport

The SafeSport course provides you with a certificate that you can download. When you
view the cert or save it, you should see a long ID number. That's the certification ID,
and you can tell the site to search the records for it.

If the record is found, that will be enough for the Got Sport system. If it's not found,
upload the certificate file instead.

### Background Checks

In the requirements table, you'll see a line for background checks with a link on the right.
You'll also get an email about this after you register, and you can just follow that link to
fill it out as well.

Fill out all the form information, check the disclosure boxes, and sign it.

![image-center](/files/bg-check-screenshot.jpg){: .align-center}

After submitting the form, go back to the dashboard, click on background check's _details_ link
again. You'll see a "Quick App" link that will let you begin the check process. Please fill
out that form to get the process underway.

For more information, please see the GotSport [guide for coaches on submitting background checks](
https://gotsport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051143533-Submitting-a-Background-Check).

### Live Scan

Every coach needs to submit a Live Scan application. You only need to do it once,
rather than annually like the rest of the certs. Unfortunately, a Live Scan for
another organization can't be used for MAYSL.

   1. Fill out the [MAYSL Live Scan form](/files/calnorth-livescan-2022.pdf).
      Use your full legal name, as found on your driver's license or California ID.
   2. Make an appointment with the Oakhurst Sheriff's office to submit your form.
   3. Bring your form and [a current, valid photo ID](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)
      to your appointment. You will be fingerprinted and your identity will be verified when
      they complete your form and submit it.
   4. Note that the submission is free for MAYSL coaches.


## FAQ

### _What if I'm worried about something that might come up in my background check?_

Write anything you're worried about on your bg check form.  The people that review it
will take your explanations into account when they approve or deny.  Denied checks can
be appealed, too, but it does slow down the process.
