MAYSL Frequently Asked Questions


## _When do you play?_

Games are on Saturdays. The season is 9 games. It usually runs from the 2nd
Saturday after Labor Day until the 1st week of November, and we skip the last
weekend of Fall Break.

Practices are mid-week. Many of the U4-U6 teams only practice at the beginning
of the season. U8 often practice one day a week, and U10+ typically practice
2 times a week.

See [Schedules]({% link _pages/schedules.md %}) for seasonal details.


## _Where do you play?_

We have games at the lower field behind Yosemite High School,
near the tennis courts and softball fields.

We practice at the fields of our area elementary and secondary
schools in Ahwahnee, Oakhurst, North Fork, Spring Valley, and YLP.

See [Game Fields]({% link _pages/schedules.md %}/#game-fields) for details.


## _What gear do I need?_

Not much! Cleats (or athletic shoes), tall socks, shin guards, and shorts are
the bare minimum.

See [Parents/Equipment]({% link _pages/parents.md %}/#equipment) for more info.


## _What if my kids can't make all the games?_

We'd still love to have your kids playing. Just let your coaches know
ahead of time so they can plan for the games you'll miss.


## _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken in the 2nd half of the season, after the
October break, and it always happens on a game day at the YHS
game field. Keep an eye on the [News](/news/) page for an
announcement each season.


## _Can my child play after they get hurt?_

If a player is injured and sees a doctor during the season (whether it happens
during soccer or outside of the league), they can't return to play until they're
cleared by a doctor to return. This includes participating in practice or games.

We want our players to play as much as possible and cheer on their teammates,
but part of learning to be a good athlete is taking good care of your body. We
certainly encourage injured players to join their teams on the sidelines until they
can return to play. You can help your coaches guide your kids by bringing them a note
from the doctor, detailing what activities are allowed and what aren't.
