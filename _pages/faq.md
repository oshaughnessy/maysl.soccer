MAYSL Frequently Asked Questions


## _Where do you play?_

We have games at the lower field behind Yosemite High School,
near the tennis courts and softball fields.

We practice at the fields of our area elementary and secondary
schools in Ahwahnee, Oakhurst, North Fork and YLP.


## _What if my kids can't make all the games?_

We'd still love to have your kids playing. Just let your coaches know
ahead of time so they can plan for the games you'll miss.


## _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken in the 2nd half of the season, after the
October break, and it always happens on a game day at the YHS
game field. Keep an eye on the [News](/news/) page for an
announcement each season.


## _Can my child play after they get hurt?_

If a player is injured, during a soccer activity or outside of the league,
and they see a doctor (or other medical professional), they can't return
to play until they're cleared by a doctor to return. This includes playing
at practice or games. We certainly encourage injured players to join their
teams on the sidelines, though, and cheer on their teammates. Help your
coaches out -- parents should bring a note from the doctor to their
coach, detailing what activities are allowed and what aren't.
