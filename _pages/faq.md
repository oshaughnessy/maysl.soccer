MAYSL Frequently Asked Questions


## _When do you play?_

Games are on Saturdays. The season is 9 games. It usually runs from the 2nd
Saturday after Labor Day until the 1st week of November, and we skip the last
weekend of Fall Break.

Practices are mid-week. Many of the U4-U6 teams only practice at the beginning
of the season. U8 often practice one day a week, and U10+ typically practice
2 times a week.

See [Schedules]({% link _pages/schedules.md %}) for seasonal details.


## _Where do you play?_

We have games at the lower field behind Yosemite High School,
near the tennis courts and softball fields.

We practice at the fields of our area elementary and secondary
schools in Ahwahnee, Oakhurst, North Fork, Spring Valley, and YLP.

See [Game Fields]({% link _pages/schedules.md %}/#game-fields) for details.


## _What gear do I need?_

Not much! Athletic shoes or cleats, tall socks, shin guards, and shorts are
the bare minimum.

See [Parents/Equipment]({% link _pages/parents.md %}/#equipment) for more info.


## _What if my kids can't make all the games?_

We'd still love to have your kids playing. Just let your coaches know
ahead of time so they can plan for the games you'll miss.


## _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken in the 2nd half of the season, after the
October break, and it always happens on a game day at the YHS
game field. Keep an eye on the [News](/news/) page for an
announcement each season.


## _Can my child play after they get hurt?_

If a player is injured, during a soccer activity or outside of the league,
and they see a doctor (or other medical professional), they can't return
to play until they're cleared by a doctor to return. This includes playing
at practice or games. We certainly encourage injured players to join their
teams on the sidelines, though, and cheer on their teammates. Help your
coaches out -- parents should bring a note from the doctor to their
coach, detailing what activities are allowed and what aren't.
