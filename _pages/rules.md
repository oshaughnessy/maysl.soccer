## Growing with the Game

Some rules are introduced as players get into older age divisions:

- start offside, substitutions, and throw-ins at U10
- start drop-kicks at U12
- start headers at U15

### No Goal-to-Goal Scoring in U8

In U8, we don't allow the goalkeeper to make a goal with a direct kick.
The ball must be touched by another player before a legitimate goal can
be made.

### Offside in U10+

[Law 11](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/), "Offside", is enforced beginning
in U9/U10.

For a friendly, clear explanation of offside rules, see
[Offside Made Easy](/files/offside-made-easy.pdf).

### Substitutions in U10+

Player substitutions during a game are only allowed when [the ball is out
of play](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-ball-in-and-out-of-play/).
For example, during a throw-in or penalty kick.

At MAYSL, we don't do single-player sub-ins until U10. In U8, a group of
players will play for 10 minutes, then the whole group will come out and
a new group will come in.

### Throw-Ins in U10+

[Law 15](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-throw-in/), "The Throw-In",
is enforced at U10 and above. For U8 and younger, we just kick from out-of-bounds.

_Why?_ Kids have trouble learning proper throw-in technique when they're that
young, and we don't want them to settle into bad habits. We've found that it's
better to wait until they're a little older and more coordinated. When we have
tried to enforce good throw-ins for 6 and 7-year-olds, we spend too much time
on the sidelines. Watch a professional game -- throw-ins should be correct _and
quick_, so we wait until they're ready to learn that.

### Heading in U15+

Heading the ball is not allowed until a player joins a U14/U15 age division.

Taken from <https://cysadistrict7.org>:

> California Youth Soccer Association Heading Policy
>
> (Approved by Board of Directors, August 4, 2019)
>
> #### Playing Policy
>
> * Heading is prohibited in 12U and younger small-sided games.
>
> * All players age eleven (11) years old and younger, who are playing
>   up in 13U and older games, are prohibited from heading, and must
>   clearly be identifiable to match official (e.g. an arm or head band).
>
> * When a player, who is eleven (11) years old and younger, deliberately
>   heads the ball in a game, an indirect free kick should be awarded
>   to the opposing team from the spot of the offense. If a deliberate
>   header occurs within the goal area, the indirect free kick should
>   be taken on the goal area line parallel to the goal line at the
>   point nearest to where the infringement occurred. If a player does
>   not deliberately head the ball, then play should continue.
>
> * All players age eleven (11) years old and younger, who participate
>   in a non-CYSA sanctioned event with their CYSA player pass, must
>   adhere to the CYSA heading policy and are prohibited from heading.
>
> #### Practice Policy
>
> * All players age eleven (11) years old and younger are prohibited from heading.
>
> * It is strongly recommended for players between the ages of twelve
>   (12) and seventeen (17) years old, heading in practice must be
>   limited to a maximum of thirty (30) minutes per week, with no more
>   than fifteen (15) to twenty (20) headers, per player, per week.
>
> * In addition, CYSA recommends that standard coaching methods to
>   instruct on how to properly head the ball be instituted by all
>   Affiliates. CYSA will assist Affiliates, as needed, in teaching
>   coaches the proper heading techniques as such to reduce the risk
>   of possible concussion.


## Team Size

If teams are short players, they can agree to play short with an
even number of players on the field. Teams may also borrow from
other teams to get to the minimum, but they may not borrow additional
players for subs.


## Play Time

All players should play at least half of each half of a game. It
is acceptable for players in younger age groups, where quarters are
played, to sit out a quarter; each player should participate in at
least half of the total game time.

Games need to start on schedule. The home team should give the
visiting team the game card (see [below](#game-supplies)) at least
20 minutes prior to the start of the game. Be ready to check in
players at least 15 minutes before game time. If games start late,
playing time will be decreased.


## Game Supplies

The home team (the 1st team in schedule listings) is responsible for
providing at each game:

- the game card
- 2 soccer balls

The coach of the home team can get the game card at the field before
game time, then fill it out with their team roster. Pass it to the
visiting team coach, who will fill it out then give it to the ref.
The ref should have the card by 15 minutes before game time.


## Uniforms

All players must wear shin guards which are completely covered by
socks (socks may not be worn under the guards and folded down over
the top.)

Sweatpants are not permitted. In cold weather long sleeve
shirts or non-hooded sweatshirts may be worn under the jersey.

No jewelry of any kind or metal is allowed to be worn in a game.

For more info, see the [Equipment section](/parents/#equipment)
on the Parents page.


## Field Care

The first teams of the day should help set up the goals on their
fields.

All teams should clean up their areas after their games.

The last teams of the day should help move them off the fields.

(The fields are used by Yosemite High School for other sports
during the week.)


## Sportsmanship

The decisions of referees must be respected. It is not acceptable
for anyone, including coaches, players, or spectators, to complain
about calls in a game.

Coaches will be held accountable for the behavior of anyone involved
with their team, including players and spectators. In cases of
excessive yelling or any behavior not in the spirit of the game,
referees may ask coaches to control behavior on their sidelines and
full support is expected. Coaches who are unable to control the
situation may be asked to leave the game or the game may be abandoned.

No coaches, substitute players, or spectators are allowed behind
either end line of the field.


### Lead Limits

The league expects its coaches to teach proper sportsmanship to players.
Coaches of teams leading by at least 3 goals should make changes to actively
level the playing field.

Please see the [Coaches section on lead limits](/coaches/#lead-limits) for more on this.
