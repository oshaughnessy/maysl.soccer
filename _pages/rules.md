## Growing with the Game

Some rules are introduced as players get into older age divisions:

- start offside, substitutions, and throw-ins at U10
- start drop-kicks at U12
- start headers at U15

### Offside

[Law 11](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/), "Offside", is enforced beginning
in U9/U10.

For a friendly overview of offside rules, see
[Offside Made Easy](/files/offside-made-easy.pdf).

### Substitutions

Player substitutions during a game are only allowed when [the ball is out
of play](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-ball-in-and-out-of-play/).
For example, during a throw-in or penalty kick.

At MAYSL, we don't do single-player sub-ins until U10.
In U8, a group of players will play for 10 minutes, then the whole group
will come out and a new group will come in.

### Throw-Ins


[Law 15](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-throw-in/), "The Throw-In",
is enforced at U10 and above.

For U8 and younger, we kick from out-of-bounds.

### Heading

Heading the ball is not allowed until a player joins a U14/U15 age division.

> California Youth Soccer Association Heading Policy
> 
> (Approved by Board of Directors, August 4, 2019)
> 
> #### Playing Policy
> 
> * Heading is prohibited in 12U and younger small-sided games.
> 
> * All players age eleven (11) years old and younger, who are playing
>   up in 13U and older games, are prohibited from heading, and must
>   clearly be identifiable to match official. (i.e. armband)
> 
> * When a player, who is eleven (11) years old and younger, deliberately
>   heads the ball in a game, an indirect free kick should be awarded
>   to the opposing team from the spot of the offense. If a deliberate
>   header occurs within the goal area, the indirect free kick should
>   be taken on the goal area line parallel to the goal line at the
>   point nearest to where the infringement occurred. If a player does
>   not deliberately head the ball, then play should continue.
> 
> * All players age eleven (11) years old and younger, who participate
>   in a non-CYSA sanctioned event with their CYSA player pass, must
>   adhere to the CYSA heading policy and are prohibited from heading.
> 
> #### Practice Policy
> 
> * All players age eleven (11) years old and younger are prohibited from heading.
> 
> * It is strongly recommended for players between the ages of twelve
>   (12) and seventeen (17) years old, heading in practice must be
>   limited to a maximum of thirty (30) minutes per week, with no more
>   than fifteen (15) to twenty (20) headers, per player, per week.
> 
> * In addition, CYSA recommends that standard coaching methods to
>   instruct on how to properly head the ball be instituted by all
>   Affiliates. CYSA will assist Affiliates, as needed, in teaching
>   coaches the proper heading techniques as such to reduce the risk
>   of possible concussion.


## Team Size

If teams are short players they can agree to play short with an
even number of players on the field. Teams may also borrow from
other teams to get to the minimum but may not borrow additional
players for subs.


## Play Time

All players should play at least half of each half of a game. It
is acceptable for players in younger age groups who play quarters
to sit out a quarter as long as each player plays at least half the
total game time.

Games need to start on schedule, so the home team needs to give the
visiting team the game card at least 20 minutes prior to the start
of the game. Be ready to check in players at least 15 minutes before
game time. If games start late playing time will be decreased.


## Game Supplies

The first team listed is the home team and is responsible for
bringing the game card.

The home team is responsible for bringing 2 game balls.


## Uniforms

All players must wear shin guards which are completely covered by
socks (socks may not be worn under the guards and folded down over
the top.) Sweatpants are not permitted. In cold weather long sleeve
shirts or non-hooded sweatshirts may be worn under the jersey. No
jewelry of any kind or metal is allowed to be worn in a game.


## Field Care

All teams need to clean up their areas after their games.


## Sportsmanship

The decisions of referees must be respected. It is not acceptable
for anyone, including coaches, players, or spectators, to complain
about calls in a game.

Coaches will be held accountable for the behavior of anyone involved
with their team, including players and spectators. In cases of
excessive yelling or any behavior not in the spirit of the game,
referees may ask coaches to control behavior on their sidelines and
full support is expected. Coaches who are unable to control the
situation may be asked to leave the game or the game may be abandoned.

No coaches, substitute players, or spectators are allowed behind
either end line of the field.


### Lead Limits

The league expects its coaches to teach proper sportsmanship to
players. Coaches of teams leading by a margin of three goals are
expected to incorporate changes into the game to better level the
playing field. All efforts must be made to keep a margin of victory
to never more than five goals.

Examples of actions that could be taken include:

* Switching players' positions around to enable those who haven't
  scored goals the opportunity to do so.
* Imposing restrictions on players, including:
** shooting with "weaker" foot only
** requiring five (or higher number) consecutive passes (without an opponent
   touching the ball) before a shot can be taken
** requiring that these passes are completed in team's own defensive half
   or any combination of these.

Examples of actions that are NOT acceptable include:

* Removing players to play down against a team.
* Removing a goalkeeper or changing the role of the goalkeeper.

Coaches should make every effort to prepare their players for
this type of a situation _before_ it happens. This preparation will
allow a team to practice fair play without broadcasting it on the
field. A coach can choose a secret word so that players are prepared
for the situation or sub in a player who can pass on the instructions
to teammates. **We are a recreational league and our priorities are
fun, skill development, and encouragement for ALL players.**
