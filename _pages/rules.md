FIFA laws of the game are followed at all age groups. Laws 2, 3 and 7 are modified as shown
in the following chart.

| Age Group | # Players | Game Length        | Ball Size
|-----------|-----------|--------------------|----------
| U4-U6     | 3v3       | 10-minute quarters | 3
| U7-U8     | 5v5       | 12-minute quarters | 3
| U10       | 7v7       | 22-minute halves   | 4
| U12       | 9v9       | 30-minute halves   | 4
| U14+      | 11v11     | 35-minute halves   | 5

Law 11 (offside) is enforced beginning in U9/U10.

Law 15 (the throw-in) is followed in all age groups but referees
may allow improper throws to be retaken in U8 and younger age groups.

If teams are short players they can agree to play short with an
even number of players on the field. Teams may also borrow from
other teams to get to the minimum but may not borrow additional
players for subs.

All players should play at least half of each half of a game. It
is acceptable for players in younger age groups who play quarters
to sit out a quarter as long as each player plays at least half the
total game time.

Games need to start on schedule so the home team needs to give the
visiting team the game card at least 20 minutes prior to the start
of the game. Be ready to check in players at least 15 minutes before
game time. If games start late playing time will be decreased.

The first team listed is the home team and is responsible for
bringing the game card.

Home team is responsible for bringing three game balls.

All players must wear shin guards which are completely covered by
socks (socks may not be worn under the guards and folded down over
the top.) Sweatpants are not permitted. In cold weather long sleeve
shirts or non-hooded sweatshirts may be worn under the jersey. No
jewelry of any kind or metal is allowed to be worn in a game.

All teams need to clean up their areas after their games.

The decisions of referees must be respected. It is not acceptable
for anyone including coaches, players or spectators to complain
calls in a game. Coaches will be held accountable for the behavior
of anyone involved with their team including players and spectators.
In cases of excessive yelling or any behavior not in the spirit of
the game, referees may ask coaches to control behavior on their
sidelines and full support is expected. Coaches who are unable to
control the situation may be asked to leave the game or the game
may be abandoned.

No coaches, substitute players or spectators are allowed behind
either end line of the field.

The league expects its coaches to teach proper sportsmanship to
players. Coaches of teams leading by a margin of three goals are
expected to incorporate changes into the game to better level the
playing field. All efforts must be made to keep a margin of victory
to never more than five goals. Examples of actions that may be taken
include:

Switching players' positions around to enable those who haven't
scored goals the opportunity to do so.  Imposing restrictions on
players including shooting with "weaker" foot only, requiring five
(or higher number) consecutive passes (without an opponent touching
the ball) before a shot can be taken, requiring that these passes
are completed in team's own defensive half, or any combination of
these.  Examples of actions that are NOT acceptable include:

* Removing players to play down against a team.
* Removing a goalkeeper or changing the role of the goalkeeper.

Coaches should make every effort to prepare their players for
this type of a situation BEFORE it happens. This preparation will
allow a team to practice fair play without broadcasting it on the
field. A coach can choose a secret word so that players are prepared
for the situation or sub in a player who can pass on the instructions
to teammates. We are a recreational league and our priorities are
fun, skill development, and encouragement for ALL players.
