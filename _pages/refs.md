## Facilitators

MAYSL has a group of trained referees who are authorized to facilitate
games only for our league.

Facilitator uniforms include:

* gray t-shirt with official badge iron-on
* black pocket shorts with no white
* black socks
* mostly black shoes

Facilitators should bring to every game:

* pen
* whistle
* large coin
* clock
* stopwatch
* ref flags

Arrive at games 30 minutes early to meet up with the game officials.


## Official Referees

### Eligibility

According to California North Referee Association (CNRA), "there are no minimum
age requirements to become a referee. However, many local leagues may require a
referee to be older than the players that they are officiating. Parents are
advised to assess the maturity level of their child prior to permitting them to
take one of the Entry Level Referee Courses."

As a league, MAYSL will require that a referee is 1-2 years older than the age
of the players they are officiating.


### Uniforms and Equipment

Every referee must provide and wear a USSF approved uniform whenever they are
reffing games. The colors change from year to year but the basic uniform is a
yellow jersey with black stripes, black shorts with pockets and black socks with
three white stripes at the top. Other approved jerseys include: red, black, and
blue but we stick with the standard yellow because all refs in a game are
supposed to match. You will also need a whistle, watch, coin and pen for all
games. As an adult you will need red and yellow cards and flags.

    on individual gear items.
 
You may buy the gear online through any soccer store or through many sporting
goods stores or other soccer stores in the Fresno Area.  They do not need to be
any specific brand.


### Scheduling

Schedules are managed by the league reffing coordinator, sgsultana@gmail.com

Schedules are completed on a weekly basis. we try to give everyone who completed
the clinic an equal opportunity to referee games. We are committed to developing
referees of all ages in the Mountain Area. Some players have schedule conflicts
with their own games so when they have a weekend off we offer them the games
first. We also try to put an experienced ref with a new ref for the first few
games. Availability and assigning is done electronically.

The coordinator will check the schedule and assign games by email.  Please
confirm your games by email otherwise they will be reassigned to someone else if
they are not confirmed by Thursday. Sometimes we have cancellations so we will
call on Friday if we have additional games that we need covered. In the past we
have had to make last minute changes on the fields due to postponements so refs
must be flexible.


### Pay

We use the game cards to keep a record of the games and also to pay the refs so
it is very important that all game cards are turned in and legible. All refs
need to print their name on the cards and make sure it is filled out properly
with the date and age group.

* U5-U8: $10/game, using one or two youth refs as centers
* U10: $20/game for the center, $10/game for assistants
* U12-U15: $25/game for the center, $15/game for assistants
* Travel games: paid for by District 7, according to their payscale

In the spring league, scheduling and pay are different. MAYSL pays referees for
travel games and District 7 reimburses the league.


## Things To Be Aware Of

### Player Safety

Learn about **concussion** symptoms and out to deal with potential head injuries.
Print out a copy of the [Concussion Recognition Tool](/files/concussion-field-guide.pdf)
that was provided as part of the US Soccer safety coarse. Familiarize yourself with it
and keep it with your field bag or clipboard. You'll have it available if one of your
players has any sign of a head injury.

Heat-related ilness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
[Recognize to Recover Heat Guidelines](/files/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf).
