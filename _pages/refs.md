Our referees range from experienced adults to youth players who are
facilitating games for younger age groups.

If you have any questions about refereeing, please reach out to
our ref coordinator, [Kay Emmert](mailto:kayemmert@yahoo.com).

For details on how to be a ref in each MAYSL age division, please see
[Ref Training]({% link _pages/ref-training.md %}).


## Facilitators

MAYSL has a group of trained referees who are authorized to facilitate
games only for our league.

Facilitator uniforms include:

* gray t-shirt with the official badge iron-on
* all-black shorts with pockets
* all-black socks
* primarily-black shoes


## Eligibility

According to California North Referee Association (CNRA), "there are no minimum
age requirements to become a referee. However, many local leagues may require a
referee to be older than the players that they are officiating. Parents are
advised to assess the maturity level of their child prior to permitting them to
take one of the Entry Level Referee Courses."

As a league, MAYSL will require that a referee or facilitator is 1-2 years older
than the age of the players they are officiating.


## Equipment

### Game Day

Officials should bring to every game:

* pen
* whistle
* large coin
* clock
* stopwatch
* ref flags
* appropriate uniform

Arrive at games 30 minutes early to meet up with the other officials.

### Referee Uniforms

Every referee must provide and wear a [USSF approved uniform](
https://officialsports.com/referee-uniforms/ussf-economy-jerseys/)
whenever they are officiating games.

Uniforms for MAYSL games include:

* yellow jersey with black stripes
* all-black shorts with pockets
* black socks with 3 white stripes at the top
* primarily-black shoes

## Schedules

Schedules are managed by the league reffing coordinator,
[Kay Emmert](mailto:kayemmert@yahoo.com).

Schedules are completed on a weekly basis. we try to give everyone who completed
the clinic an equal opportunity to referee games. We are committed to developing
referees of all ages in the Mountain Area. Some players have schedule conflicts
with their own games so when they have a weekend off we offer them the games
first. We also try to put an experienced ref with a new ref for the first few
games. Availability and assigning is done electronically.

The coordinator will check the schedule and assign games by email.  Please
confirm your games by email otherwise they will be reassigned to someone else if
they are not confirmed by Thursday. Sometimes we have cancellations so we will
call on Friday if we have additional games that we need covered. In the past we
have had to make last minute changes on the fields due to postponements so refs
must be flexible.


## Pay

Game cards are used not only to keep a record of the games, but also to track
time for paying referees. On each game card, every participating referee or
facilitator should print their name. Ensure that the date and age group are
included as well.

Rates as of 2019:

* _U5-U8:_ $20/game if alone, $15/person if shared
* _U10:_ $20/person/game
* _U12-U15:_ $25/person/game
* _U16:_ $45/person/game if paired, $45 for lead & $30/helper if 2 helpers
* _Travel games:_ paid for by District 7, according to their payscale

In the spring league, scheduling and pay are different. MAYSL pays referees for
travel games and District 7 reimburses the league.

### Player Safety

Learn about **concussion** symptoms and how to deal with potential head injuries.
Print out a copy of the [Concussion Recognition Tool](/files/concussion-field-guide.pdf)
that was provided as part of the US Soccer safety coarse. Familiarize yourself with it
and keep it with your field bag or clipboard. You'll have it available if one of your
players has any sign of a head injury.

Heat-related ilness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
[Recognize to Recover Heat Guidelines](/files/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf).


### Rule Highlights

[Within US Youth Soccer](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/referees/rules-of-the-game/),
the [FIFA Laws of the Game](https://www.ussoccer.com/referee-program/laws-of-the-game)
are used, but various accommodations for small-sided games with younger players are
made to create a journey that encourages age-appropriate fun and skill development.
See [Growing with the Game](/rules/#growing-with-the-game) on the Rules page for
specific insights.

Please see [Ref Training]({% link _pages/ref-training.md %}) for guidance on how to
